## About

> The "Electoral Guardian" project was developed to automate the verification of the authenticity of electoral videos. It integrates various computer vision technologies and deepfake detection models, enabling the analysis of submitted videos and the generation of reports on their reliability.

> The main goal is to combat misinformation during the electoral period by saving time for journalists, fact-checkers, and voters through a centralized virtual assistant for analyzing suspicious content.

> The project was born out of the author's desire to create a socially impactful tool that uses artificial intelligence to promote information integrity.

### Tech Stack

> Programming Language: Python

> APIs: Hugging Face Transformers (ViT_Deepfake_Detection), WhatsApp Business API (simulated)

> Frameworks and Libraries:

> OpenCV,  
> PIL (Pillow),  
> Transformers (pipeline),  
> Requests,  
> LangChain (core for future integration),
> os
> shutil

> Infrastructure: Docker, ffmpeg (for media processing), integration with local files simulating input via WhatsApp

> Others: Docker, cURL, Flask and ngrok to host the webhooks

### Presentation
> Slide used in the demonstration video presentation [slides presentation](docs/slides.pdf).


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

> Python 3.12
  Recommended for compatibility with torch, opencv-python, and other libraries.

> Hugging Face account with access to the Wvolf/ViT_Deepfake_Detection model
  Required to use the deepfake detection pipeline. 

> Dependencies installed via pip
> langgraph
> langsmith(for future monitoring of the agents)
> transformers
> pyngrok
> opencv-python
> Pillow
> flask
> python-dotenv
> pyngrok

### Installation

> **1. Clone the repository**

> Download or clone the repository containing the following project files:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lorenzomatheo/guardiaoeleitoral
cd guardiaoeleitoral
```

> **Included files:**

> - electoralguardian.ipynb  
> - server.py  
> - LICENSE.txt
> - SECURITY.md
> - CONTRIBUTING.md  
> - requirements.txt  

> **2. ENV Configuration**

> Set the `API_INSTANCE_ZAPI`,`INSTANCE_TOKEN`,`PHONE_NUMBER`,`CLIENT_TOKEN`and `PORT` in your .env file with your keys:

```bash
API_INSTANCE_ZAPI = "<Z-API instance ID>"
INSTANCE_TOKEN = "<Instance token provided by Z-API>"
PHONE_NUMBER = "<WhatsApp phone number with country and area code, e.g., 5511999999999>"
CLIENT_TOKEN = "<Client token (separate from the instance, depending on Z-API>"
PORT = "<Port where your Flask application will run, e.g., 5001>"
```
All this informations you take here: https://app.z-api.io/

> **3. Install dependencies**

> Run locally:

```bash
! pip freeze > requirements.txt
! pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> **4. Run the server**

> Run in 2 different terminals:

```bash
ngrok http 5001
```
```bash
python server.py
```

The ngrok NEEDS to be in the same port of the Flask beacuse the Falsk server don't catch the webhook received from ngrok, and in the moment you restart the application, you need to paste the new "Forwarding" in the Z-API camp 'Upon receiving"

More about this: https://developer.z-api.io/

## Usage

> **Sending the media and executing the notebook**

> Just send the video for the contact who you scanned the QR Code in Z-Api instance web and execute the cells
